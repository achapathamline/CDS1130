During the time period 1990-1995, the Roads and other MnDOT BaseMap data layers were digitized from USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles using MicroStation CADD. A total of 1745 quadrangles were digitized. For any given area, MnDOT used the most recent quadrangle available at that time. The digital MicroStation CADD files were converted from State Plane Coordinates to UTM and then converted into ARC/INFO coverages. The ARC/INFO files were merged into statewide, seamless coverages and then attributes were added. 

Beginning in March, 1999, the Roads features were checked and updated, using 1997 digital orthophotos for Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington Counties and 1991 digital orthophotos for the remaining 80 counties. 

The Roads features layer is updated continuously as information comes in to the Office of Transportation System Management. The Minnesota Trunk Highway (TH), County State Aid System (CSAH), and Municipal State Aid System (MSAS) alignments and route data are improved each year through our annual status process. Changes to roads come from several sources including county engineers, city engineers, GIS personnel and the MnDOT State Aid office (which manages county state aid highways and municipal state aid streets), the most recent aerial photos available, and construction plans.
