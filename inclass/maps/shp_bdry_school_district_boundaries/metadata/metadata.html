					Section 1: Overview
				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>Originator:</span><span>Minnesota Department of Education</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Title: 
					</span><span>School District Boundaries, Minnesota, SY2023-2024</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>This file represents a statewide compilation of the boundaries of all independent, common, and special school districts in the state of Minnesota. Minnesota school districts are asked to report any changes to their district boundaries annually. With the exception of consolidations, dissolutions, or other financial cooperation agreements, the reporting is not mandatory. As independent special purpose government organizations, school districts determine their own attendance boundaries, working with neighboring districts and county auditors to ensure proper taxation. The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) plays no role in determining the actual boundaries.
<br>
<br>Since 2008, district boundaries have also been reviewed against the school district coding provided in county parcels, where it exists. (Parcel data are supplied by counties to MnGeo, who in turn share that with MDE.) The results are overall increased accuracy, but also increased complexity. Conversations with county GIS coordinators and auditors are ongoing with respect to the complex situations reflected within county parcel data, and whether or not these are accurate representations of school district boundaries. Since school year 2021, many of those "islands" or other unusual situations have been eliminated or simplified as a result of those conversations.
<br>
<br>This file is not intended to represent the "true" boundaries with respect to taxation, but as generalized boundaries focused on ensuring accurate representation in residential areas. As a result, starting in 2021, boundaries have been simplified by removing complex situations in non-residential areas, such as transportation Right-of-Way (ROW), publicly-owned land, tax exempt land, or water. This simplification work is expected to continue in coming years.
<br>
<br>This data is now also available in CSV format. OBJECTID and Shape columns have been removed from that format.<br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Purpose: 
					</span><span>This school district boundary information is developed as a GIS dataset and, along with additional information, is used by the Minnesota Department of Education for various regulatory and advisory purposes, including identifying program financial priorities and reporting to the US Census Bureau.
<br>
<br>As independent special purpose government organizations, school districts determine their own attendance boundaries, working with neighboring districts and county auditors to ensure proper taxation. The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) plays no role in determining the actual boundaries. MNIT staff supporting MDE merely attempt to compile the most accurate representation possible that affects housing.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

					Section 2: Data Quality
				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Attribute Accuracy: 
					</span><span>Each school district checks the previous year's map for accuracy of school names and boundaries. Changes are verified by the Minnesota Department of Education. School district boundaries are dissolved from a larger statewide school district file containing elementary, middle and high school attendance boundaries. Boundaries are maintained within an enterprise geodatabase.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Logical Consistency:
					</span><span>Data are topologically structured and verified.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Completeness:
					</span><span>All independent, common, and special school districts within Minnesota are included. Prior publications included a boundary for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport; in order to facilitate relationships to the MDE ORG database, this record was removed. It is no longer included in the Richfield Area school district boundary, but instead is a "hole" in the dataset. (Please note that airports are detached from school district boundaries as per MN 473.625.)</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Horizontal Positional Accuracy:
					</span><span>Positional accuracy of the data sources varies widely. Source scales range between 1:24,000 (or less) and 1:100,000. In early compilations, many of the boundaries were hand-drawn by the school districts.
<br>
<br>In an ongoing process since 2008, school district boundaries have been modified to a greater accuracy using county parcel datasets. In general, non-residential areas are reviewed at a scale of 1:24,000, and residential areas at a scale of 1:10,000. See notes on simplification efforts in the Abstract, and on potential boundary inaccuracies under 'Lineage', particularly within metadata on historical versions of this dataset.</span></div><br><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Lineage:
					</span><span>For a detailed lineage of the development of this dataset, refer to the metadata packaged with the historical versions available on the MN Geospatial Commons.
<br>
<br>For school year 2023-24, no major consolidations or dissolutions were executed. Only minor boundary changes were implemented, when discovered via review of county parcel/taxation data.
<br>
<br>NOTES ON MISMATCHES OF DATA:
<br>
<br>1. The County Auditor's Office is required to delineate school district boundaries by law, and maintains the official record for tax purposes. Note that school districts also have boundary maps, and that, while the two sets of map boundaries should match, they do not always. In cases where the school district and the county auditor records show different boundaries, this should be resolved locally first before suggesting updates to MDE. Statewide compilation efforts are complicated when updates are obtained from multiple sources.
<br>
<br>2. Mismatches between the Census Boundary lines and the School District lines: although the school district boundary file generally uses Census geography where possible, it does not always follow precisely. Therefore, mismatches between this file and school district boundaries maintained by the Census can be legitimate. As of 2019, MDE is updating Census versions via the Census School District Reporting Program (SDRP) annually. However, due to the limitations of this program, there will always be mismatches, particularly along detailed borders such as those defined by water bodies.
